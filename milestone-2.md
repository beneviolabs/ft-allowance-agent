#### Milestone 2

<b>Audience:</b> Crypto-Native Users.
<b>Overview:</b> Your self-described luddite friend finds Peerlio from a web search, after a brief chat with the Peerfolio Agent, Friend is convinced that they will use Peerfolio as their first venture into acquiring crypto.


#### Requirements and Acceptance Criteria
- As a user (cryto native) I should be able to onboard into the fully designed, mobile-first Peerfolio app, deployed on a v0.peerfolio.app domain, where I'm able to choose my preferred wallet to connect my existing near account, setup my trading account and initiate the purchase of a recommended set of tokens via a coinbase onramp flow, and confirm the creation of the agent's suggested allowance goal, which the agent will attempt to execute pending the market conditions.
