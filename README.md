### Onboarding sequence

These are all the various components that interact during a user's onboarding.

Examples
  - Approve txn: https://testnet.nearblocks.io/txns/CF1ainGjroxtppNTWWkFgQsiC5kC4iJ3X7v8FgLMrWDE?tab=execution
  - deposit and create proxy: https://testnet.nearblocks.io/txns/CF1ainGjroxtppNTWWkFgQsiC5kC4iJ3X7v8FgLMrWDE?tab=execution#GV1aG4CqY6Lm2L28yb3tdinD2vZ7mZRS8fvPfBzahcnp
  - MPC key registration: https://testnet.nearblocks.io/txns/5Jyn459DhAaRxEqvTo3x724cgxCpjTH1Jaoc7uyVNQt9

### Agent execution sequence (swaps etc.)

TBD

#### MPC Secured Agent Autonomy

1. [The limited access trading account](https://github.com/beneviolabs/ft-allowance-agent/blob/main/contracts/auth_proxy.rs) manages authorized users for signature requests, allows one to transfer tokens to their trading account and grant an AI agent (i.e any other Near Account) permission to call this proxy contract to request MPC approval to send transactions to a predefined set of contracts and methods (i.e. near_deposit on wrap.testnet). Thereby allowing an Agentic account to act autonomously on your behalf with restricted permissions and access only to the tokens that you transfer to your trading account. The system consists of two main contracts:
    1. Factory Contract (factory.rs):

    - Acts as a proxy contract deployer
    - Stores proxy code hash for verification
    - [Creates proxy instances](https://testnet.nearblocks.io/txns/8Q8mPTCUxaJnTubwE6ZTHF1ZLvxo9BhVfBBifsuriXAD) with proper initialization
    - Ensures secure deployment with minimum deposit requirements
    Example usage: `near call auth-v0.peerfolio.testnet deposit_and_create_proxy \
  '{"owner_id": "alice.testnet"}' \
  --accountId alice.testnet \
  --deposit 4`

    2. Auth Proxy Contract (auth_proxy.rs):

    - Manages authorized users for signature requests
    - Handles MPC signature generation for approved transactions
    - Restricts contract interactions to predefined set (wrap.near, intents.near)
    - Supports specific methods (near_deposit, add_public_key, etc.)
    Example usage: `near call alice.auth-v0.peerfolio.testnet  request_signature \
  '{...signature_args...}' \
  --accountId authorized-agent.testnet`


### Deleting a trading/proxy account

1. Add your main account public key to the proxy account with full access permissions
```
near contract call-function as-transaction <mainaccount>.auth-v0.peerfolio.testnet add_full_access_key json-args '{"public_key": "<main-account-public-key>"}' prepaid-gas '100.0 Tgas' attached-deposit '0 NEAR' sign-as <mainaccount>.testnet network-config testnet sign-with-keychain send
```

2. Send a delete account transaction signing with your main account key pair
```
near account delete-account <mainaccount>.auth-v0.peerfolio.testnet beneficiary <mainaccount>.testnet network-config testnet sign-with-plaintext-private-key --signer-public-key <main-account-public-key> --signer-private-key <main-account-private-key> send
```

#### TODO - Replace the examples and scripts with details on how to onboard via the langchain agent.

#### Examples
1. [This testnet txn](https://testnet.nearblocks.io/txns/Hi2pfe89tBdMN2oY2dFXLuHcSBVFotx6pHViDQuKUZDi) converting 1 Near to WNear by `agent.charleslavon.testnet` was initiated by `benevio-labs.testnet` who was pre-approved by auth_proxy.rs to use Near's MPC contract to [create a signature](https://testnet.nearblocks.io/txns/831u2KqbdtzvJti5HUhGnp4tZD7Q8onUzD11rwBjrAAm).
2. [This mainnet txn](https://nearblocks.io/txns/GRw6oEWjAQ2QT9oDtsgBSRWr3s4oCW4A8zCpHCRXD62s) adding a public_key onto `intents.near` was initiated by `benevio-labs.near` who was pre-approved by auth_proxy.rs to [create an MPC signature](https://nearblocks.io/txns/9PJXbvcb4RMxjwK8VW4N54RnvrjENUCr6N1nv9f3DZJQ).


#### Setup dependencies
1. Install near-cli-rs
2. Set your target network as an environment variable e.g. `export NEAR_ENV=testnet`
3. Also add your factory account address and factory owner address into factory/factory-deploy.sh, e.g. `FACTORY_ACCOUNT="auth-v0.peerfolio.$NETWORK"
FACTORY_OWNER="peerfolio.$NETWORK"`
4. Login with a near testnet account and choose to save the private key into your mac's keychain, `near login`
5. Need tokens? Use a [Near testnet faucet](https://near-faucet.io/) to fund your account.
6. Build and install rust tooling

    ```bash
    # if running on Apple Silicon.
    rustup toolchain install nightly-aarch64-apple-darwin
    rustup component add rust-src --toolchain nightly-aarch64-apple-darwin
    cd contracts && ./build_auth_proxy.sh
    cd factory && ./factory-deploy.sh
    ```

#### Setup your proxy account
1. TODO - update with link to our langchain onboarding UI.

#### Test Requesting Signatures
1. Go to [NearBlocks](https://testnet.nearblocks.io/), on the upper right select the `Near Icon`, then `testnet`, then click into a `Latest Block` and copy the block hash.  Now you can simulate a program or agent using your proxy contract by requesting a signature, `./request_signature.sh <block hash> < add_key | deposit > <your-other-account.testnet>`
2. If successful, transaction logs (view them in your terminal or on nearblocks.io) should display the Reconstructed Signature in base64 (scroll up or search for `Signed transaction (base64)`).  Pass this signature `./submit_txn.sh` to test broadcasting this testnet transaction. `./submit_txn.sh FAAAAGNoYXJsZXNsYXZvbi50ZXN0bmV0AQD1k+Pq3bhLFaNXClzgx0fEBmZItkkolypTJq0v0O6JOB856PxW5l+TZwD6MTrEBY+xsI/3wBgz2RNY+Ax5RETZq+2FlQEAAAwAAAB3cmFwLnRlc3RuZXQwRFzWCwWaY4pPFHl46Bj87dj6JLtdm28rjKf37iFc4QEAAAACDAAAAG5lYXJfZGVwb3NpdAAAAAAAoHJOGAkAAAAAAKHtzM4bwtMAAAAAAAAButebmlYXbKcuRM9NfWfgOAdR9jzGvS4Fv53T4/wOGjwwjizI0PvKnpaCpsxkNyTFZHQEVpYkCNPnUbabAYYx/QI=`
