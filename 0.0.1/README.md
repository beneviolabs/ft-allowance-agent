## setup

This is the Python source code.

1. Create a wallet if you don't have one via [Bitte](https://wallet.bitte.ai)

1. Sign up on [near.ai](https://app.near.ai/) with your Bitte wallet.

1. Install nearai CLI

   ```sh
   pip install nearai
   nearai version
   ```

1. Log the CLI in and auth with your Bitte wallet

   ```sh
   nearai login
   ```

1. Create a directory named after your Near account in the `~/.nearai/registry` directory

   ```sh
   mkdir -p ~/.nearai/registry/my-acc.near
   ```

1. Clone the repo and install the dependencies

   ```sh
   cd ~/.nearai/registry/my-acc.near
   git clone git@github.com:beneviolabs/ft-allowance-agent.git
   cd ft-allowance-agent
   python3 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

1. Run the agent locally

   ```sh
   nearai agent interactive ~/.nearai/registry/<your-acc>.near/ft-allowance/0.0.1 --local
   # > hi
   # < Assistant: Hello! I'm here
   ```

   > ℹ️ In case you don't get any responses, add print to the library `nearai/agents/agent.py` file in your site-packages

   ```python
   def run_python_code(...):
     ...
     # ln: 152
     except ...:
       print(f"Error running agent code: {e}")
   ```

   Other SDK logs can be found at `/tmp/nearai-agent-runner/ptke.near/ft-allowance-agent/0.0.1/system_log.txt`.

## Deploying

1. Ensure you have an empty app called `test-app` in your Near account. If not, use nearai CLI to create and deploy it.

1. Ensure `show_entry` is set to true and run the following from the 0.0.1 directory
   ```
   nearai registry upload --bump
   ```

1. Go to your nearai dashboard and find your new deployment

1. If you wanna hide the bot, set the show_entry field in metadata.json file to false and run `nearai registry upload --bump` again to set the listing to private.

1. If there is a dependency that needs to be updated, we need to submit a pull request to the nearai repo to update their aws_runner dependencies over [here](https://github.com/nearai/nearai/blob/main/aws_runner/frameworks/requirements-standard.txt).


### Troubleshooting deployments and the deployed running application

- Add `DEBUG=true` to the env vars and check the `ℹShow system logs` checkbox that sits left to the send message button. This will show you stacktraces and debug level logs.

- Deploy doesn't show up: If a newly deployed version doesn't show up on the UI check the metadata.json. if you got any fields wrong or missing your new version might not be listed. Also make sure `show_entry` is set to true.

- If the description field is too long you will get a HTTP 500 error.
